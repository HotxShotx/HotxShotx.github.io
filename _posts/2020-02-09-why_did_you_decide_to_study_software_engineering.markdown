That simple question. I ask myself that question all the time. The utter significance of that sentence is huge to me. I told myself that one day I want to be capable of impacting myself and others in a huge way. When I started to stumble onto coding and programming I was in my second semster of college. At the time I wanted to be a Biomedical engineer. The simple idea of my own hands being capable to hold so much power stunned me. In fact it haulted me in my tracks because the courses offered to me at my college didn't offer the passion and happiness coding presented to me. I started to research and look for the next path that would be appropiate for me to take in order to fufill this dream. In the search I found a great big community of people who are passionate about programming as much as me or even more. Soon after months of learning and deciding whether or not to follow my dream I found flatiron. This reassured me that I have the power, a forgotten power, to push my life in the direction I truly wanted it to go; Not the direction my parents or society or the school that accepted me wished for me. Furthermore I decided to study Software Engineering to push towards my passion and enjoyment in technology and my own dreams.
